# binary_trees
## About
An introductory project on:
- Binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- Depth, height and size of a binary tree
- Different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- A complete, a full, a perfect and a balanced binary tree
## File Description
### Tasks
**0-binary_tree_node.c :**
    * A function that creates a binary tree node
    * Returns - a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure
    
**1-binary_tree_insert_left.c :**
    * A function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
    * Returns - a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
      
**2-binary_tree_insert_right.c :**
    * A function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
    * Returns - a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
      
**3-binary_tree_delete.c :**
    * A function that deletes an entire binary tree
      
**4-binary_tree_insert_right.c :**
    * A function that checks if a node is a leaf
     
**5-binary_tree_insert_right.c :**
    * A function that checks if a given node is a root
    * Returns - a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL

**6-binary_tree_insert_right.c :**
    * A function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

**7-binary_tree_insert_right.c :**
    * A function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

**8-binary_tree_insert_right.c :**
    * A function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

**9-binary_tree_insert_right.c :**
    * A function that measures the height of a binary tree
